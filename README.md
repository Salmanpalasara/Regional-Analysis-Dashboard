# 📊 Regional-Analysis-Dashboard



  This project is a data analytics and visualization solution built using Python (EDA) and Power BI (Dashboard). The goal is to perform a comprehensive sales analysis across regions, products, and channels to generate valuable business insights that can help in decision-making and strategy building.

🚀 Project Objectives

  Analyze sales performance across different regions, channels, and product categories.
  
  Identify key trends and patterns in revenue and profit.
  
  Highlight seasonal/temporal trends to optimize planning.
  
  Build a Power BI dashboard to present findings in an interactive and business-friendly way.


🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

  Performed using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn

✅ Steps:

1. Data Cleaning

  Removed duplicates and missing values
  
  Handled outliers in revenue and profit
  
  Standardized date formats and categorical fields

2. Data Transformation

  Extracted Year, Month, and Quarter from dates
  
  Mapped state codes to corresponding regions
  
  Created calculated columns: Revenue per Order, Profit Margin (%)

3. Descriptive Analysis

  Revenue, Profit, and Order distribution
  
  Central tendency (mean, median, mode) and spread (variance, std dev)

4. Trend & Correlation Analysis
  
  Revenue/Profit trends across months
  
  Correlation between unit price, order quantity, and revenue
  
  Impact of sales channels on overall performance

5. Segmentation Analysis

  Sales performance by Region
  
  Top-performing Products/Channels
  
  Geographic sales insights
